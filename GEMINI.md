# Gemini Project Summary

## Project: MSPR Nantes Docker - Election Prediction

This document summarizes the work done on the project, its current state, and the next steps.

### Work Done

1.  **Data Pipeline (ETL) Fixed**:
    *   The ETL script `src/etl/build_master.py` was completely overhauled.
    *   It now correctly processes the detailed election result files (`*_par_commune.csv`) instead of the incomplete `elections_master_2012_2022.csv`.
    *   It automatically calculates the winning party (`parti_en_tete`) for each election, which is the target variable for the models.
    *   This results in a much richer and more accurate dataset (`data/processed_csv/master_ml.csv`) with 312 rows and 133 columns.

2.  **Model Training Script Improved**:
    *   The training script `src/models/train.py` was made more robust.
    *   An imputation step was added to handle missing values (NaNs) in the data, which was causing the training to fail.
    *   The script now trains and compares four different classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.
    *   Label encoding was added for the XGBoost model, which requires integer labels.

3.  **Documentation Updated**:
    *   The `README.md` and `docs/HOWTO.md` files were updated to reflect the changes in the data pipeline and the ETL process.
    *   A new `mspr.md` file was created to serve as a synthesis document for the project, as requested by the MSPR subject. This file traces the work done and identifies the remaining tasks.

### Current State

*   **Data**: The data pipeline is now robust and produces a clean and complete dataset for model training.
*   **Models**: The training script is set up to train and evaluate four different models. The training is currently failing because of a `NameError: name 'LabelEncoder' is not defined` in `src/models/train.py`.
*   **Documentation**: The documentation is up-to-date with the latest changes.

### Next Steps (TODO from `mspr.md`)

-   [ ] **Fix the `NameError` in `src/models/train.py`** by adding the import for `LabelEncoder`.
-   [ ] **Run the training script successfully** for all four models.
-   [ ] **Analyze and synthesize the results of the models** in the `mspr.md` file.
-   [ ] **Generate and insert visualizations** (maps, graphs) into the `mspr.md` file.
-   [ ] **Determine the most correlated data** with the results by analyzing the feature importance of the models.
-   [ ] **Create the Conceptual Data Model (CDM)** in the `mspr.md` file.
-   [ ] **(Optional) Improve the models** by testing other algorithms or optimizing hyperparameters.
-   [ ] **(Optional) Add more detailed comments** to the source code if necessary.
-   [ ] **(Optional) Clean up the `docker-compose.yml` files** by removing the `version` attribute.

### Key Learnings & Challenges

*   **Docker Cache**: I encountered a persistent issue with the Docker cache, where the changes to the scripts were not being reflected in the container. The solution was to use the `--build` flag with `docker compose run` to force a rebuild of the image.
*   **Label Encoding**: The XGBoost model requires integer labels for the target variable. I had to add a `LabelEncoder` to the training script to handle this.
*   **Debugging in Docker**: Debugging scripts running inside a Docker container can be challenging. I had to use various techniques, such as redirecting output to a log file and adding print statements, to understand what was happening inside the container.
